[comment]: <> (# About code.)

[comment]: <> (# In this code researched Gradient or Cauchy method - first order method vs Newton's method -  second order method)

[comment]: <> (# The code illustrates the advantages of the second order method over the first order method.)

[comment]: <> (# The classical gradient algorithm has been writed and ploted its convergence.)

[comment]: <> (# The Newton's method has been writed.)

[comment]: <> (# This is a second-order method using the Hessian matrix - a matrix of estimates of the second derivatives.)

[comment]: <> (# The convergence of Newton's method is investigated vs Gradient convergence.)
